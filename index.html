    <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Finneas Scott I am currently taking my second year of courses at Florida Gulf Coast University and pursuing a major in Mathematics and a minor in Physics.  I am also a high school graduate from Gulf Coast High School and was at University of South Florida for a year.  I am currently residing in Fort Myers, Florida in my apartment.  My experience of math includes physics one honors, high school and college algebra, pre-calculus, and currently calculus one.  I have also volunteered at the Domestic Animal Services assisting in taking care of the animals at the facility and helping the workers there. </p>
      <p>Some of my work includes making this portfolio website for myself and have made a game in the program Scratch.  I have also been taking Code Academy on learning computer programming such as HTML and CSS.  I have also tutored kids for math problems and other school work they may have trouble with.  Other experiences I have include arrays, computing hardware, how it is assembled, and software that are used such as Base 8 and Pep/8.  I have an alright understanding of programming but, I am a fast learner and will learn other things if I need to in the future.</p>
